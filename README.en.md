# Python Deep Learning Examples

During my journey of learning deep learning, I encountered numerous challenges. For me, the two biggest obstacles were:

1. Most tutorials focus heavily on theory, but without hands-on practice, it’s hard to truly grasp the concepts.
2. Practical projects on GitHub are often too comprehensive, including many aspects unrelated to understanding theory, such as parallel computing and model optimization. Furthermore, many projects are provided as `.py` files instead of Jupyter notebooks, which makes it even harder for beginners like me to read and understand.

To address these two issues, I built this project with a focus on using the simplest possible code to demonstrate deep learning concepts in practice. The goal is to help others understand the theory through hands-on experience.
